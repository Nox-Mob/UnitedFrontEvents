[h2]Operation Longbow[/h2] [b]UF_Kohat_CacheDefense_v1[/b]
[i]Asymmetric CAF vs. INS one-life Cache Defense.[/i]

Your NATO Sniper Platoon is tasked with destroying a hidden insurgent weapons cache. Intel about the operation was leaked by a NATO spy so expect heavy resistance as well as quick reinforcements. Drop 400m out, move in on foot, and get out alive. Good luck.

[i]Symmetric USA vs. RUS one-life FOB defence with unlimited attacker spawns.[/i]

US defenders are to maintain control of FOB at Sokolov from sqarming RUS forces. They have 40 minutes to take the point.  
One-life US defends against an unrelenting RUS force at Sokolov, the US's last remaining FOB in the area. US will get the 8 minute staging phase to construct non-lethal emplacements (save .50 cal) to defend against the attack.
