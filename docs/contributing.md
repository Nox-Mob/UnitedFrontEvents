# Contributing

If you're going to contribute, send me a Discord message or Email and let me know what you plan on doing. Don't be lazy, put things in the correct directory, and only edit current files if necessary. Make a pull request and I'll do my best to get to it ASAP.

Please also include changes to assest that I will be working with too. UE4 stores all it's assets in binary files, so I can't merge them automagically, I have to make those merges manually and I can't without the information on what you changed.

Most steps are in the modded guide with some specific steps.
