# Contributing

If you're going to contribute, send me a Discord message or Email and let me know what you plan on doing. Don't be lazy, put things in the correct directory, and only edit current files if necessary.

Make a pull request including detailed changes of shared files and I'll get to it ASAP.

Including changes is required for assets that others will be working with. UE4 stores all it's assets in binary files, so git can't merge them automagically. I have to make those merges manually and I can't without the information on what you changed.
