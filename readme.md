# United Front Events

This mod was created by AleX to help facilitate better loading/wait times during events. Some admin intervention may still be required, but setup times are now to a minimum.

### [Operation Longbow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CVyPtZjW3r3GyhZs1tDADObci9r0GJn8m44u40QcMZo/edit?usp=sharing)

***Asymmetric CAF vs. INS one-life Cache Defense.***

Your NATO Sniper Platoon is tasked with destroying a hidden insurgent weapons cache. Intel about the operation was leaked by a NATO spy so expect heavy resistance as well as quick reinforcements. Drop 400m out, move in on foot, and get out alive. Good luck.

### Operation Survival

***Symmetric USA vs. RUS one-life FOB defence with unlimited attacker spawns.***

US defenders are to maintain control of FOB at Sokolov from sqarming RUS forces. They have 40 minutes to take the point.  
One-life US defends against an unrelenting RUS force at Sokolov, the US's last remaining FOB in the area. US will get the 8 minute staging phase to construct non-lethal emplacements (save .50 cal) to defend against the attack.

### HVT Escort

***Symmetric US vs. RUS two-life High Value Target escort mission.***

HVT escort team is tasked with escorting their HVT (commander) to a given point on the map. The map is open, use the landscape to your advantage. This is a slower mission so it could be paired with some high-paced action missions like a FOB defense or something similar. Team members have two lives each, use them wisely.

### Bolty Bois

***Symmetric BAAS US vs. US tickets or spawn kill mission.***

Each team has a temporary spawn for their inital spawn to build a HAB in the compound they spawned in. They are to kill the other team while playing an AAS style game. Once the last point has been taking, the enemy main can be sieged and taken.
