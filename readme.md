# United Front Events

This mod was created by AleX to help facilitate better loading/wait times during events. Some admin intervention may still be required, but setup times are now to a minimum.

### [Operation Longbow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CVyPtZjW3r3GyhZs1tDADObci9r0GJn8m44u40QcMZo/edit?usp=sharing)

***Asymmetric CAF vs. INS one-life Cache Defense.***

Your NATO Sniper Platoon is tasked with destroying a hidden insurgent weapons cache. Intel about the operation was leaked by a NATO spy so expect heavy resistance as well as quick reinforcements. Drop 400m out, move in on foot, and get out alive. Good luck.

### Operation Survival

***Symmetric USA vs. RUS one-life FOB defence with unlimited attacker spawns.***

US defenders are to maintain control of FOB at Sokolov from sqarming RUS forces. They have 40 minutes to take the point.  
One-life US defends against an unrelenting RUS force at Sokolov, the US's last remaining FOB in the area. US will get the 8 minute staging phase to construct non-lethal emplacements (save .50 cal) to defend against the attack.

### [Operation Neptune Spear](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1obIT8PYWr2mtyYGo8qHYwKD4ZWztqBXWe9S8eN9Fago/edit?usp=sharing)

***Asymmetric CAF vs. INS one-life High Value Target hunt.***

Elusive Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden has been located, hiding in plain sight in a small urban compound. The United States will conduct an aerial raid on his compound, with the primary objective of killing or capturing Osama Bin Laden and the secondary objective of securing Al Qaeda intelligence.
